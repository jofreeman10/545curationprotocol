This dataset is a display of the rates of recycling of several materials, including paper, plastic, and metal, in three cities--New York, Washington, D.C., and Phoenix, Arizona. This dataset was created in the winter of 2021. It is aimed at policymakers interested in information around recycling participation in major cities. It is freely available. The dataset has been left in both .xlxs and .csv formats. One set is raw data, the other is normalized; they are labeled as such. The data is normalized with z-scores in order to assess distance from averages for all three cities.
